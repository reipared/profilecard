# Introduction

This is a README file template for a Neomorphic Profile Card. The profile card design showcases a user's profile image, name, role, a brief description, and social media statistics.

## Code Explanation

The HTML and CSS code provided in this README file template are responsible for creating the visual layout and styling of the profile card. Here's a breakdown of the code:

### HTML Structure

The HTML code defines the structure of the profile card using various HTML tags:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration sets the document type to HTML5.
- The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata and external resources.
- The `<meta>` tags specify the character set and viewport settings.
- The `<link>` tags import external CSS files and font icons.
- The `<title>` tag specifies the title of the webpage.
- The `<body>` tag represents the document's body and contains the profile card elements.

Within the `<body>` tag, the profile card is structured as follows:

- The main container `<div>` with the class `profile_card` represents the entire profile card section.
- The profile image container `<div>` with the class `user_img` displays the user's profile picture.
- The user details container `<div>` with the class `user_details` holds the user's name, role, description, and hire link.
- The horizontal rule `<hr>` creates a visual separator.
- The unordered list `<ul>` with the class `social-media-icons` contains the social media icons and statistics.
- Each social media item is represented by a list item `<li>`, containing the icon, follower count, and span for the follower label.

### CSS Styling

The CSS code provided in the template styles the HTML elements to achieve the Neomorphic design of the profile card. Here's an overview of the key CSS styles used:

- The `*` selector applies the box-sizing border-box model and sets the font family to 'Poppins'.
- The `body` selector centers the profile card vertically and sets the background color.
- The `.profile_card` class styles the main container, including dimensions, color, alignment, padding, border-radius, background, and box-shadow.

- The `.user_details` class styles the user details container, including alignment, margin, and typography.
- The `.user_details h5` and `.user_details span` classes style the user's name and role text.
- The `.user_details p` class styles the description text.
- The `.user_details a` class styles the hire link button and adds a hover effect.
- The `hr` selector styles the horizontal rule element.
- The `.social-media-icons` class styles the social media icons container, including alignment.
- The `.social-media-icons li` class styles each social media item, including alignment and margin.
- The `.social-media-icons li a` class styles the social media icon, including dimensions, color, and border-radius.
